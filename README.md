# Potato-Disease-Classification
The Potato Disease Detection project is a web app that uses deep learning (CNN) to identify diseases in potato leaves. The backend, powered by FastAPI, processes images for predictions, while the frontend, built with ReactJS, provides an easy-to-use interface for farmers and researchers to detect and manage diseases.
