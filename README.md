# Potato-Disease-Classification
The Potato Disease Detection project is an innovative web-based application aimed at helping farmers and agricultural researchers identify potato plant diseases using machine learning. The application leverages deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), to analyze images of potato leaves and determine whether the plant is infected by any of several common diseases. The backend is powered by FastAPI, providing a fast and efficient API, while the frontend is built using ReactJS, offering an intuitive user interface for seamless interaction.
## Features

- **Disease Detection:** Classifies potato leaf diseases based on uploaded images.
- **Fast Predictions:** FastAPI backend ensures quick processing and results.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** ReactJS frontend offers an intuitive interface for easy use.

## Technologies Used

- **Deep Learning (CNN):** Convolutional Neural Networks for image classification.
- **FastAPI:** Backend framework to serve the model and handle requests.
- **ReactJS:** Frontend for building the user interface.
- **TensorFlow/Keras:** Used for training and running the CNN model.
- **Docker:** For containerizing the application.
